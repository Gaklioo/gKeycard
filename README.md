A keycard scanner for the game of garrys mod, in the style of the SCP Foundation

Features:
Team Overrides
Password Protection
Access Level 0-5
Keycard Usage Log
Admin Configuration in game
Data storage for the entity [Requires the entity to be perma propped, and when saving call ENT:SaveData(), when loading call ENT:LoadData()]
Keypad can be linked to doors in game by editing door linkage and pressing mouse 1 on a door
DNA Scanning [Currently has no visual representation, might change later but its okay]
[Note: DNA Scanning has now been changed to a type of fingerprint recognition, but is still named DNA within the files. I change later :)]

Progress:
Complete, every feature is functional and works correctly. The style may be inconsistent but for now it is time for the next project and to refine what I learned from this.
